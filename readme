The goal of this project is to brush up my web development skill and to experiment new things that I learn in the process of doing so.

The idea is that I want to build a full functioning website for a friend of mine so he can use it for his business. His business is to provide yoga classes.

I am yet to find out all the requirements from him. In the meantime, I am just putting things based on my best knowledge of providing yoga classes.
